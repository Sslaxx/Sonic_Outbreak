# FIXME: This script needs re-writing to be better able to handle, among other things, collision issues.
# FIXME: As defined in Player_Movement_Plans.md - so state machine(s)(?).
# FIXME: And cycle of processing should be input -> modify movement vectors/check collision/etc -> move.
# FIXME: Taking into account potentially different playstyles/character abilities will make this trickier.
# FIXME: The SPG's numbers may be broadly fine for a Megadrive, but work poorly with Godot.
# FIXME: An easy solution may be to multiply all the numbers by 60 (explicitly, as opposed to using a var).
# FIXME: i.e. accel = 28.125 as opposed to accel = 0.46875 * special_number (as done currently).
# FIXME: Assuming of course values are all pixels/second or frames/second. Not that it's going to be that straightforward.
# FIXME: Also framerates are insane! Due, in part, to this issue (and as far as I can see delta not being used).
