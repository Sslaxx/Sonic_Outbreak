   Generic badnik script.

   All badniks will inherit this script (which itself extends from KinematicBody2D). This script doesn't do much by itself.
   It controls a badnik's hit points and score value. It has a generic "badnik_hit" function. Most badniks will use it, but
   some may not be able to. Unlike the player scripts, most logic for badniks will be in the script meant for the badnik and
   not this script.
